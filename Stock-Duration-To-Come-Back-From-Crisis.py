# Generating a table with the worst crisis for a stock over a given period of time. And the time it took for the stock to come back to the initial price it had fallen from.
# 
# This will give an historical view of the kind of crises a company faced in its history, and the duration it took the company to recover form that crisis.
# 
# 
# | Company   | Crisis     |  Low | from High | Change | got back by | after (years)
# |-----------|----------- |------|-----------|--------|-------------|--------------
# | Boeing    | 1973-03-10 | \$10 |  \$20     | -50%   |1976-09-10   |3.5

# ## Parameters

# ### `stock`

# Captures the sock (company) to be studied. 
# 
# The variable should be set with the official "Ticker" of the company.
# 
# E.g: `stock = 'AAPL'` for Ticker AAPL (Ticker of the company Apple).

# In[22]:


stock = 'BA' # stock under study. Boeing in this case.
stock_name = 'Boeing'


# ### `period`

# Period of time under study. 
# 
# This is the period of time during which we want to find the crisis for the stock under study.
# 
# For example, it can be the last 5 years, the last 10 years or the maximum period for which we have data.

# In[23]:


period = 'max' # valid period values: 1y,2y,5y,10y,ytd,max


# ### `time_window`

# The time window is the moving time interval used to calculate the loss of the sotck.
# At each point in time, the loss will be calculated compared to a reference point dated at the beginning of that time window.
# 
# This way, the loss calculated will be representative of the loss over that rolling time window.
# 
# E.g.: 
# `time_window = '20'`
# The change will be calculated over a rolling time window of 20 trading days.
# 

# In[24]:


time_window = 20 # in open trading days


# ### `large_loss`

# A stock will be considered to have a crisis if the loss it suffers over the `time_window` is larger than `large_loss`.

# In[25]:


large_loss = -0.30 # large loss (a percentage number: large_loss = -0.30 represents a loss of -30%)


# ## Implementation

# ### Get the stock historical price data for the period under study

# Use the yfinance module to download the daily data for the period. And store the result in a Pandas DataFrame.

# In[26]:


df = yf.download(tickers=stock, period= period, interval='1d') # Download the data
df.drop(columns=['Open','High','Low','Adj Close','Volume'],inplace=True) # Drop unnecessary columns
df.insert(0, 'Company', stock_name) # Insert a column "Company" with the stock name in it
df.head() # Display the first rows of the data


# ### Calculate Change over the `time_window` rolling period

# Create a column to store the reference price at the beginning of the time window.

# In[27]:


df['Reference Price'] = df.Close.shift(time_window)
df


# At the beginning of the data, we cannot get a reference point back the entire time window because we do not have the data before that point.
# 
# We will replace the missing values by the oldest possible price point available: the first historical price point available in the data.

# In[28]:


df.fillna(value=df.iloc[0]['Close'],inplace=True)
df


# Calculate the change column: last "Close" compared to "Reference Price" (the reference price being the price of the stock at the start of the `time_window`.

# In[29]:


df['Change'] = (df['Close']-df['Reference Price']) / df['Reference Price']
df


# ### Find the worst crisis

# To find the worst crisis, we are going to search for local minimums in the "Change" column. 
# 
# And then find those "Change" local minimums that are inferior to the `large_loss` parameter.
# 
# E.g.: Worst crisis of Boeing over a month (loss larger than -30%).

# In[30]:


# Create a column with the local minimums (change smaller than the one before and the one after)
df['Local Min'] = df.Change[ (df.Change.shift(1)>df.Change) & (df.Change.shift(-1)>df.Change) ] 
df


# Address the fact that the very last price could be a local minimum as well.
# 
# If the very last price is smaller than the day before, then consider it as a local minimum as well.

# In[31]:


if df.loc[df.index[-1],'Change'] < df.loc[df.index[-2],'Change']: # if the last change is smaller tham the day before  
    df.loc[df.index[-1],'Local Min'] = df.loc[df.index[-1],'Change'] # consider the last change as a local minimum
    
df


# Find out the worst crisis by selecting  the rows for which the Change has a Local Minimum inferior to the `large_loss` parameter defined at the top of the Notebook.
# 
# `df1`will be a smaller copy of the larger `df`. `df1` being will be used to ultimately represent the final output of that entire Notebook.

# In[32]:


df1 = df[ df['Local Min'] < large_loss ].copy()
df1


# It happens that we have several local minimums in the span of a `time_window`.
# 
# In order to avoid redundancy and keep only the worst loss point for each crisis, we will keep only the largest loss endured during the span of a given `time_window`.
# 
# The following function will use a `time_cursor` that will go iteratively at the start of each `time_window`, get the local minimums for that `time_window`, and keep only the worst date as being representative of the crisis during that `time_window`.
